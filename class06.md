# JS Object Literals; The DOM
### WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

##### - IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
##### - IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS

### ACCESSING AN OBJECT AND DOT NOTATION 
You access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation. You can also access properties using square brackets.
ex: 
>var hotelName = hotel.name;

>var roomsFree = hotel.checkAvailability();

## DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
#### THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE
As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes.
