# Choosing A Text Editor
## What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
## What features should you look for in a text editor?
- code completion :
- syntax highlighting
- nice series of themes

## Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer
Usually, the text editors that come on your computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.
- make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your computer, that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere (maybe on your Desktop, for example) to store your entire website.
- Also, please make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names
