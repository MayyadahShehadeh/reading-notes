# Choosing A Text Editor
## What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
## What features should you look for in a text editor?
- code completion :
- syntax highlighting
- nice series of themes

## Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer
Usually, the text editors that come on your computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.
- make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your computer, that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere (maybe on your Desktop, for example) to store your entire website.
- Also, please make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names
## Third-Party Options
software like:
- Notepad++
- Text Wrangler
- BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code

# Linux Tutorial
## Linux Tutorial - 1. The Command Line
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.
### The Shell, Bash:
- There are various shells available but the most common one is called ***bash*** which stands for Bourne again shell. This tutorial will assume you are using bash as your shell.
- If you would like to know which shell you are using you may use a command called ***echo*** to display a system variable stating your current shell. echo is a command which is used to display messages.
## Linux Tutorial - 2. Navigation
- The first command we are going to learn is ***pwd*** which stands for Print Working Directory. The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is.
- It's one thing to know where we are.  The command for this task is ***ls***. It's short for list
- In order to move around in the system we use a command called ***cd*** which stands for change directory. 
## Linux Tutorial - 3. More About Files
### Linux is Case Sensitive:
This is very important and a common source of problems for people new to Linux. Other systems such as Windows are case insensitive when it comes to referring to files. Linux is not like this. As such it is possible to have two or more files and directories with the same name but letters of different case.
- #### Escape Characters
Another method is to use what is called an escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ). What the backslash does is escape (or nullify) the special meaning of the next character.

- #### Hidden Files and Directories
The command ***ls*** which we have seen in the previous section will not list hidden files and directories by default. We may modify it by including the command line option ***-a*** so that it does show hidden files and directories.
