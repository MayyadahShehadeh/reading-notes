# How JavaScript Makes Webpages more interactive
JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser.
Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to:
- Access the content of the page
- Modify the content of the page
- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
- React to events triggered by the user or browser

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
