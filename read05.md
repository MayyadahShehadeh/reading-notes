# COMPARISON OPERATORS :
<<<<<<< HEAD
###  EVALUATING CONDIRIONS:
you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the cript to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.

> #### "==" ---> IS EQUAL TO  | "!=" ---> IS NOT EQUAL TO|
>#### "===" ---> SRTICT EQUAL TO  | "!==" ---> SRTICT NOT EQUAL TO
> #### ">" ---> GREATER THAN | "<" ---> LESS THAN 
> #### ">=" ---> GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO | " <=" ---> LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 
# lOGICAL OPERATORS:
Comparison operators usually return single values of TRUE of False . Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
### Example: 
> ((5<2) && (2>=3))

#### THE LOGICAL OPERATORES ARE: 
##### 1- "&&" ---> LOGICAL #AND
##### 2- "||" ---> LOGICAL #OR
##### 3= "!" ---> LOGICAL #NOT

# LOOPS 
Loops check a condition. if it returns TRUE, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns TRUE, the code block will run again. it repeats until the condition returns FALSE.
### - WHILE:
if you don't know how many times the code should run, you can use a WHILE loop. Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is TRUE.
### - FOR:
