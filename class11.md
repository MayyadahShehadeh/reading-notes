# Audio, Video, Images
## Images:
- Background Images
The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

- background-repeat
The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

- Background Position
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.
