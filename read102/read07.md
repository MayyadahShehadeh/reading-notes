# Introducing CSS
CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
## Example Styles:
#### BOXES
- Width and height
- Borders (color, width, and style)
- Background color and images
- Position in the browser window
#### TEXT
- Typeface
- Size
- Color
- Italics, bold, uppercase,
- lowercase, small-caps
#### SPECIFIC
- There are also specific ways
in which you can style certain
elements such as lists, tables,
and forms.

# COLOR 
#### Foreground Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
- rgb values
-  hex codes
- color names
Example:

> /* color name */
h1 {
color: **DarkCyan**;}
/* hex code */
h2 {
color: **#ee3e80**;}
/* rgb value */
p {
color: **rgb(100,100,90)**;}

## Understanding Color
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want you can use a color picker.

>Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them). When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture. The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue  just like on a television screen.
