## what is Git?
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

## Download Git
In order to use Git, your computer must have it available. If you already have Git on your computer, you should make sure you have the latest version.

Git can be installed in three ways:

1. Install as a package
2. Install via another installer
3. Download and compile the source code.

## Check Settings
To check settings, use the git config --list command.

## Stashing Changes
When you are not ready to commit changes but do not want to lose them either, git stash is a great option. This command temporarily removes changes and hides them, giving you a clean working directory. When you are ready to continue working on the changes, simply use the git stash apply command to retrieve the hidden changes.
