- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
## DOCTYPES
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).
## - Block Elements
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
## - Inline Elements 
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
