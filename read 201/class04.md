# HTML & Css & JavaScript
## HTML & Css
### - Links
Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
#### - Linking to Other Sites
Links are created using the <*a*> element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.
##### Ex : <*a href="http://www.imdb.com"*>IMDB<*/a*>


#### - Email Links mailto: 
To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <*a*> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
 ## Css
 ### - position:static
 In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be: position: static;
  ### - Floating Elements
The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible
#### - Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
### - Page Sizes
Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

## JavaScript
#### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

#### ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS & FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS 
Expressions produce a value. They can be used where values are expected. If a function is placed where a browser expects to see an expression, (e.g., as an argument to a function), then it gets treated as an expression. 
#### VARIABLE SCOPE 
The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
### How does pair programming work?
pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture.

### - Why pair program?
#### 1. Greater efficiency
#### 2. Engaged collaboration
#### 3. Learning from fellow students
#### 4. Social skills
#### 5. Job interview readiness
#### 6. Work environment readiness
