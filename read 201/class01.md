- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
## DOCTYPES
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).
## - Block Elements
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
## - Inline Elements 
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
## Headers & Footers
The <*header*> and <*footer*> elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
● A header or footer for an
individual <*article*> or
<*section*> within the page.
## Navigation
The <*nav*> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

## Why People Visit YOUR Website?
Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users. To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask: 
1- The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site.
2- The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site now.

# JavaScript
## The ABC of Programming:
A  What is a script and how do I How do create one?
B How computers fit in with the world around them?
C How do I write a script for a web page?
  
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
1. DEFINE THE GOAL:
First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT :
To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow.
3. CODE EACH STEP:
Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the compu ter understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. As tempting as it can be to start coding straight away, it pays to spend time designing your script before you start writing it. 
## OBJECTS & PROPERTIES 
OBJECTS (THINGS)
In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object. There are two different types of objects here: a hotel and a car.
Programmers might say that there is one instance of the hotel object, and two instances of the car object.
Each object can have its own:
• Properties
• Events
• Methods
Together they create a working model of that object.
