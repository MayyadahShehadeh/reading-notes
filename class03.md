## HTML & CSS
### - Ordered Lists
<*ol*> : The ordered list is created with the <*ol*> element.
<*li*> : Each item in the list is placed between an opening <*li*> tag and a closing <*/li*> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
### - Unordered Lists
<*ul*> : The unordered list is created with the <*ul*> element.
<*li*> : Each item in the list is placed between an opening <*li*> tag and a closing <*/li*> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
### - Box Dimensions
**width, height**
The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.
### - Overflowing Content
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
1. hidden
2. scroll

### - Border, Margin & Padding
