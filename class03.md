# HTML & CSS & JavaScript
## 1. HTML & CSS :
### - Ordered Lists
<*ol*> : The ordered list is created with the <*ol*> element.
<*li*> : Each item in the list is placed between an opening <*li*> tag and a closing <*/li*> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
### - Unordered Lists
<*ul*> : The unordered list is created with the <*ul*> element.
<*li*> : Each item in the list is placed between an opening <*li*> tag and a closing <*/li*> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
### - Box Dimensions
**width, height**
The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. Traditionally, pixels have been the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.
### - Overflowing Content
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
1. hidden
2. scroll

### - Border, Margin & Padding

 #### - Border Style
You can control the style of a border using the border-style property. This property can take the following values:
solid, Dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge.. etc.
### - Padding
The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border. 
### - Margin
The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels, although you may also use percentages or ems.

## 2. JavaScript:
### - ARRAYS
- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
- You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a **list** or a set of values that are **related** to each other. 

**CREATING AN ARRAY :**

> var colors;

> colors ['white', 'black', ' custom'];

>var el document.getElementByld('colors');

>el.textContent = colors[O]; 

### - if..else statements
The if.. else   statement checks a condition. If it resolves to true the first code block is executed. If the condition resolves to false the second code block is run instead.

### - SWITCH STATEMENTS 
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

### - SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES 
Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but  they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1 se).
