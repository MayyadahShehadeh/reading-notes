# 3. Getting Started with GitHub Pages

## What is GitHub?

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pagesâ€™ content and style remotely via the web or locally on your computer.
