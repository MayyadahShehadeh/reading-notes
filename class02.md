# HTML & CSS
## Headings

HTML has six "levels" of headings:
<*h1*> is used for main headings
<*h2*> is used for subheadings


## Bold & Italic 
- By enclosing words in the tags <*b*> and <*/b*> we can make characters appear bold.
- By enclosing words in the tags <*i*> and <*/i*> we can make characters appear italic.


## Author Details 
- <*address*> : to containvcontact details for the author of the page
- <*del*> : element can show text that has been deleted from it.
- <*s*> : t indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).

## CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

- **Selectors** indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.
- **Declarations** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.

## Java Script

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

### - STATEMENTS
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
- Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
- Statements should end with a semicolon. 

### - WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables. 

### - DATA TYPES :

##### - NUMERIC DATA TYPE 
The numeric data type handles numbers.
ex: 0.75 

##### - STRING DATA TYPE 
The strings data type consists of letters and other characters.
ex: 'Hi, Ivy!'

##### - BOOLEAN DATA TYPE 
Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false. 

## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES:
#### 1- The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number. 

#### 2- Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, firstName might be used to store a person's first name, l astNarne for their last name, and age for their age.

#### 3- All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.


## COMPARISON OPERATORS :

###  EVALUATING CONDIRIONS:
you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the cript to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.

## LOGICAL OPERATORS:
Comparison operators usually return single values of TRUE of False . Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
Example: 
> ((5<2) && (2>=3))
