# WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

Grouping together the statements that are required to answer a question or perform a task helps organize your code. Furthermore, the statements in a function are not Ã¡lways executed when a page loads, so functions also offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task. The script can then ask the function to perform all of those steps as and when they are required. For example, you might have a task that you only want to perform if the user clicks on a specific element in the page.
## A BASIC FUNCTION 
> var msg = 'Sign up to receive our newsletter for 10% off!';
function updateMessage() {
var el = document.getElementByld('message'};
el .textContent = msg;
}
updateMessage(};

## DECLARING A FUNCTION 
To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a *function declaration*.

> Function sayHello(){
> document.write('Hello!');
}

## CALLIN A FUNCTION

Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is known as calling the function.

>sayHello();
