## 1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
- PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource. It is used to set an entity’s information completely.

- Unlike PUT, PATCH applies a partial update to the resource.
This means that you are only required to send the data that you want to update, and it won’t affect or change anything else. So if you want to update the first name on a database, you will only be required to send the first parameter; the first name.

## 2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server

[1. WireMock](http://wiremock.org/)

[2. Postman Mock Server](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/)

[3. Stoplight](https://stoplight.io/mocking/)

## 3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

## 4. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
