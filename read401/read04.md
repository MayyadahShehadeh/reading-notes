## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

1. Better program design and higher code quality

When writing tests, programmers first have to define a goal they will achieve with the code piece. Developers estimate an experience it will give and the way it will match with other pieces of the entire code. A developer keeps in mind everything, from an interface to a work plan.

2. Detailed project documentation

When writing tests for particular requirements, programmers immediately create a strict and detailed specification. It already includes all the likely users’ actions.

3. Code flexibility and easier maintenance
When writing code, developers strive to get fewer bugs, which considerably influences business spending.

According to the IEEE Software publication, implementation of Test Driven Development reduces the percentage of bugs by 40 - 80 percent, which consequently means that less time is required for fixing them.
