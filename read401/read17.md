### 1. Describe “The Cloud”: 
"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

The cloud enables users to access the same files and applications from almost any device, because the computing and storage takes place on servers in a data center, instead of locally on the user device. This is why a user can log in to their Instagram account on a new phone after their old phone breaks and still find their old account in place, with all their photos, videos, and conversation history. It works the same way with cloud email providers like Gmail or Microsoft Office 365, and with cloud storage providers like Dropbox or Google Drive.


### 2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and libraries required to run your software services.

Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer’s personal laptop. From Gmail to YouTube to Search, everything at Google runs in containers.

### 3. What is auto-scaling?
Auto scaling, also referred to as autoscaling, auto-scaling, and sometimes automatic scaling, is a cloud computing technique for dynamically allocating computational resources. Depending on the load to a server farm or pool, the number of servers that are active will typically vary automatically as user needs fluctuate.

Auto scaling and load balancing are related because an application typically scales based on load balancing serving capacity. In other words, the serving capacity of the load balancer is one of several metrics (including cloud monitoring metrics and CPU utilization) that shapes the auto scaling policy.

### 4. What is bandwidth?
The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time.

### 5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
When you ask an IaaS cloud provider for a price quote, it’s important to understand how they set prices for their services. The three biggest cost centers related to a cloud environment include network, compute, and storage.

### Terms: 

**Server Instances:**
 A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.

**Containers:** 
Containers are lightweight packages of your application code together with dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and libraries required to run your software services.

**Cloud Services:** 
The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware. From checking email to collaborating on documents.

**Cloud Architecture:**
 defines the technology components that are combined to build a cloud, where resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network. The components of a cloud architecture include: 

- A front-end platform (the client or device used to access the cloud) 

- One or more back-end platforms (servers and storage) 

- A cloud-based delivery methodology 

A-  network to connect cloud clients, servers, and storage  

Together, these technologies create a cloud computing architecture on which applications can run, providing end-users with the ability to leverage the power of cloud resources. Although the term cloud computing is relatively new (21st century), the concept of cloud computing is very similar to mainframe computing,  popular since the 1960s, where centralized servers ran applications that were used by ‘dumb’ terminals connected to a private network.
