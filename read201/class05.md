#### - Image Formats: 
1. JPEG : is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception.
2. PNG :  a PNG image would retain higher quality than an image than JPEG and would look a lot sharper, it would also occupy more space on the disk. 
3. GIF : images are now mainly used only if the image contains animations.
