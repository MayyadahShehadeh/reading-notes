# Process and design 

## Who is the Site For? 

Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is. 
You should know the audience’s gender, age, in which country,...etc. 

## Why People Visit YOUR Website 

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason. You should know thier Key Motivations and their Specific Goals 
Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.
