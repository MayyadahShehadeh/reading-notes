## Who is the Site For?

You should know the audience’s gender, age, in which country,...etc.

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason. You should know thier Key Motivations and their Specific Goals 

Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.
